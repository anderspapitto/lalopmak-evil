colemak-evil
============
Colemak Evil is a set of remappings that implements some of [Shai Coleman's awesome Vim remappings](http://colemak.com/pub/vim/colemak.vim) in Emacs ([more information](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=50)).

It's usable but incomplete, and because I'm an expert at neither Emacs nor Vim, improvements will come slowly.

Setup
-----
1. [Install Evil](http://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home). 
2. Download Colemak Evil and put it somewhere in your load path.
3. Add the following to ~/.emacs:
```elisp
(load "colemak-evil-remaps")
```
