colemak-evil
============
Colemak Evil is a set of remappings that implements some of [Shai Coleman's awesome Vim remappings](http://colemak.com/pub/vim/colemak.vim) in Emacs ([more information](http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=50).

It's usable but incomplete, and because I'm an expert at neither Emacs nor Vim, improvements will come slowly.
